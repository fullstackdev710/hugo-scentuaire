White Tea & Bamboo provides a delicate, earthy, and floral scent to the home, providing the ideal balance of aromas to both invigorate and relax. Let White Tea & Bamboo be your guide to a more focused, calm, and peaceful lifestyle that gives you the space to be inspired.

The fragrance begins with top notes of Bergamot and Rose, exploding with a floral intensity that remains delicate and subtle while also inspiring. Adding honey to the top notes lends White Tea & Bamboo a sweetness that endears itself to the senses.

Our White Tea & Bamboo aroma blend is at the heart of the fragrance. White Tea is a delicate scent designed to soothe the soul and calm the mind. These qualities are further enhanced by the earthy tonality of Green Floral Bamboo, creating a powerful bouquet of aromatic experience.

White Tea & Bamboo's base notes are similarly grounding, allowing the fragrance to mature into a profound scent that focuses the mind and relaxes the body. Further bases notes of Ginger and Amber lend additional warmth to the blend, creating a reflective and homely atmosphere in the space for you to enjoy long-term.
