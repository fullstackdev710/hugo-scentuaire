Our White Tea fragrance is a stunningly elegant scent that feels intensely aromatic and incredibly calming in equal measure. Exquisite, ethereal, and exotic, White Tea transforms any space into a calming atmosphere perfect for healing the mind and body.

Top notes of Violet Petal are immediately noticeable, lending this fragrance a deeply floral quality that makes its introduction to your home seamless and soothing. A further note of coconut similarly emerges, transforming your space into a zone of fresh introspection.

Expressions of White Tea Leaves are the core of the heart notes for this fragrance, crafting an exquisite sensory experience of ethereal sophistication designed to soothe the soul. Further floral elements to the White Tea aroma emerge as well, forming a powerful bouquet thatâ€™s sweet on the tongue while leaving a light kiss on the skin.

As it matures, our White Tea fragrance leaves base notes of Cedarwood to form a grounding, earthy base that centers the mind and relaxes the body. A further base note of clove is also introduced, giving our White Tea fragrance a touch of spice to warm the heart.
