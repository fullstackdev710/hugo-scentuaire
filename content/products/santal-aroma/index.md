Our Santal fragrance needs no introduction with its full-bodied aroma creating an experience that is both sensual and sophisticated.

Santal is the result of a match made in heaven, taking the earthy musk of Fresh Woods and layering it deftly with the rich warmth of Amber. Each of these ingredients forms the indelible base aroma of Santal, creating an exotic and intriguing base that lets its further complexities emerge.

Heart notes of leather and Cypress spring forth as Santal matures on the palette, further enhancing the sensation of adventure and exploration. Cardamom similarly appears, affording Santal an edge of spice and resinous sophistication in equal measure.

Finally, top notes of Bergamot and Violet float through the bouquet to lend this fragrance a light floweriness that plays with the senses and invites you to experience the adventure it promises.

Santal is a versatile fragrance designed to give you a delightful profile that infuses itself with your surroundings while leaving a kiss of warmth on the skin as it evaporates. So, whether youâ€™re looking for a bold start to your morning, a warm touch to your afternoon, or require a sense of sophistication to your evenings, Santal can provide the perfect environment for any experience.
